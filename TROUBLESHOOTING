TROUBLESHOOTING file of the RoboEarth Cloud Engine
--------------------------------------

TS1.	Launching initServer.py fails (Process communication failure, Never ending communication tries). 
	What to do about it ? 
	
	First check if there is another Server.py/Container.py running. Terminate all and restart
        This may also be due to a race condition and we still have not figured out :(.
        Terminate and restart should do the job.Bug Soon to be fixed.	

TS2.	Where do I find the logs ?
	The framework logs can be found:
		Currently flushed to the sys.stdout and you can pipe it to a file if needed. 
		
	Container level logs can be found inside: 
		/opt/rce/container/data/<container-name>/ros
		/opt/rce/container/data/<container-name>/rce	

TS3.	How do find more information on running containers ?
	The command [lxc-ls] lists all the running containers.
