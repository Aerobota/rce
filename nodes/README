Content of folder nodes
=======================

-   BarCodeService:
        Contains three nodes for 1) Scanning an image for a barcode,
        2) Query different webDBs for information about barcode, 3) some
        semantic processing of collected data.
        
        ToDo:   improve semantic processing
    
-   ReadTextService:
        Contains a node which provides an interface for the ROS node
        "read_text", which can extract text from images.
        
        ToDo:   investigate behaviour when processing multiple requests
                in parallel (uses temporary files with same filename?)

-   TTSService:
        Contains a node which provides an interface for text2speech from
        the festival package.

-   Test:
        Only for debugging purposes of file transport (obsolete with
        intoduction of TTSService which also uses this functionality).
        Implements the add_two_ints_server from ROS Tutorials and
        additionally returns an image.


Setup of nodes
==============

For a setup on a standard ubuntu installation:

0)  Complete the setup steps from root README

1)  Install dependencies for all nodes:
    -   ROS dependency:
        
          $ sudo apt-get install ros-electric-vision-opencv
    
    -   Dependency for Semantic processing:
            
          $ sudo apt-get install python-nltk
    
    -   Dependency for barcode scanning:
        
          $ sudo apt-get install python-zbar
    
    -   Dependency for web database access:
            get google-api-python-library here
                http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/
    
    -   Dependencies for leptonica image prcessing library:
        
          $ sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev libjpeg62-dev libtiff4-dev zlib1g-dev
    
    -   Use the patched versions of the ROS packages tesseract and liptonica
        form the folder patch or use the original packages from
            http://www.ros.org/wiki/
        
        If the pachted version for tesseract is used one has also to download
        the trained data for the english language from here:
            http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/
        
        Copy the file tessdata/eng.traineddata to
            nodes/tesseract/share/tessdata/
    
    -   Use the ROS package read_text from
            http://www.ros.org/wiki/
    
    -   Dependency for text-to-speech node:
        
          $ sudo apt-get install festival

2)  Possible configuration files are:
    -   BarCodeService/*.conf
