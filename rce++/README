rce++ is a header only client with dependencies on binary boost libraries.

Dependencies:
    websocketpp - http://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp
    
    Requires:
      - boost library 1.xx
        
        - successfully compiled and linked with 1.52
        - default boost library 1.46 of ubuntu 12.04 is insufficient
	
      - curl library
      
          sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

Necessary libaries to link against:
    LDLIBS=-lwebsocketpp -lboost_system -lboost_date_time -lboost_regex -lboost_random -lboost_thread

Test the client:
    To the test rce++ client:
      1. Build the test application (configure Makefile appropiately)
      
           cd test
           make
      
      2. Use the ROS client (pyrce/ros.py) to setup the container for
         the rce++ test (ROS client needs a working ROS environment).
         
           cd ../pyrce
           ./ros.py ../test/ros.cfg
      
      3. Run the test application
      
           cd ../rce++/test
           ./test [IP addres of cloud engine]
         
         You should send and receive "Hello World!" messages which can
         be checked using the command
         
           rostopic echo /stringEchoReq
         
         to check what is sent and the command
         
           rostopic echo /stringEchoResp
         
         to check was is received from the cloud engine.
