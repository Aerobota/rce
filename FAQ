--------------------------------------
Q1.	Client can not connect, because userID/robotID is already used.
A1.	Wait a minute. userID/robotID pairs are not immediately removed,
	but stored for a reconnection attempt. (Client does not support
	this yet.)

Q2.	Container can not be created, because tag is in use in Container
	Manager.
A2.	Occurs when a Container is started and immediately removed, before
	the Container Manager has finished the starting procedure which
	results in the error that the Container can not be removed and the
	tag is blocked.
