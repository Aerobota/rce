Q1.	Launching initServer.py fails (Process communication failure, Never ending communication tries). What to do about it ?
	First check if there is another Server.py/Container.py running. Terminate all and restart
	This may also be due to a race condition and we still have not figured out :(. 
	Terminate and restart should do the job.Bug Soon to be fixed.
